# M3: Model Experimentation and Packaging
## Objective: Train a machine learning model, perform hyperparameter tuning, and package the model for deployment..  
## Tasks:  
	1.Hyperparameter Tuning:
		• Use a library like Optuna or Scikit-learn’s GridSearchCV to perform hyperparameter tuning on a chosen model.
 		• Document the tuning process and the best parameters found.
	2.Model Packaging:
		• Package the best-performing model using tools like Docker and Flask.
		• Create a Dockerfile and a simple Flask application to serve the model.

## Deliverables:
	• A report on hyperparameter tuning results.
	• A Dockerfile and Flask application code.
	• Screenshots of the model running in a Docker container.
